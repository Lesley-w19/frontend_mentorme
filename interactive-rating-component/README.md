## My process
- I started the challenging by typing in my html code, then I wrote the css styling.
- On the css, i used media queries to create responsiveness in my page.
- Lastly, I went on to write javascript code, which entails functionality for user interaction such as shifting to the next page after submission.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Javascript - for the functionality
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Some of my major learnings while working through this project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

``` css
:root{
  --values
}
```
```js
//- forEach is used with querySelectorAll.
btnRate.forEach((button) =>{
  //code
})
//- addEventListener has 2 arguments passed to it.
button.addEventListener("click", () =>{
     //code
  })

```

### Continued development

In this project, i have learned the **forEach keyword** and would like to refine it and practice is even in my next challenges. 
I also learned the concept of **childNodes** and how one is able to target children in an element.



### Useful resources

- [childNodes](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24596091/javascript-targeting-child-elements-in-a-id) - This helped me with the concept of targetting childNodes. I really liked this concept and will use it going forward.
- [active class](https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+add+class+active+button+in+js&oq=how+to+add+class+active+button+in+js&aqs=chrome..69i57j0i546l5.38760j1j7&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#kpvalbx=_aqqcYvqIJJ2Gxc8PnIOIuAw16) - This video helped me understand how to add classList. In this case, how to add the ".btn-active" to my rate buttons.I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
